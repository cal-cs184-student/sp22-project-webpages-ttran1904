Project 1

**Task 1**
First I will make sure that the order of the points are clockwise, so that we
will know that **inside** the triangle will be on the right of the test line. To do that I 
will compare the  slope, let:
- a = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) 
- b = (y3 - y2)/(x3 - x2)
If:
- a > b: clockwise
- a < b: counter clockwise
- a = b: colinear
