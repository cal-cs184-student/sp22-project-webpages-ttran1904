Project 1

**Task 1**
In order to rasterize a triangle I did these steps:
- Make the order of the points are clockwise: helpful to keep track that for every
line test, we rasterize the **inside** the triangle will be on the right of the test line.
To do make point 1, 2, 3 clockwise, I compare the slope:
    - a = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) 
    - b = (y3 - y2)/(x3 - x2)
    If:
    - a > b: clockwise
    - a < b: counter clockwise
    - a = b: colinear
- Bound a pixel box to rasterize the image. Minimum and maximum x & y bounds.
- Do 3 line tests: I created a helper function call "line_test" that takes in point p and 
compare to the line with 2 reference points rf1 and rf2.
- If all 3 line test succeed. I will rasterize that point

My algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle.
That is because for each point, if it fails 1 line test, then the program will ignore that
point and continue to test the next point. Therefore, it will save a lot of time instead of 
checking all 3 points at once.

I optimized it with bounding box for each triangle. The time (clock() unit time miliseconds):
- No bounding box: 1997983
- Has bounding box: 9222



** Task 2**
In order to implement supersampling, I just resize the sample_buffer matrix to 
the appropriate amount (width * height * sample_rate). Similarly, I try to fill the 
buffer frame for supersampling according to the square root of the sample_rate. 
Finally, I average out the sample to get the lower resolution buffer.
